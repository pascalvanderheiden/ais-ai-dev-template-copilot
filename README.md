# AIS AI Development Template with Copilot

An Azure Integration Services development template that leverages AI agents and GitHub Copilot to automate the creation of comprehensive integration patterns, specifications, and implementations.

## Overview

This template implements an autonomous agent flow for Azure Integration Services development, utilizing specialized AI agents to streamline the entire development lifecycle from discovery to documentation.

## Agent Flow

The development workflow follows a structured approach using specialized agents:

    A[üïµÔ∏è Discovery Analyst<br/>Generates IDD] --> B[üìã Solution Architect<br/>Creates IRD]
    B --> C[üîß Agent<br/>Creates dev-plan, creating and assigning issues to GitHub Coding Agent]
    B --> D[üîß Integration Developer<br/>Develops code using AZD templates and Bicep]
    D --> E[üîç Test Engineer<br/>Creates tests, executes & reports the results]
    E --> F[üìö Documentation Specialist<br/>Generates Final Docs]
```

### Agents

1. **Discovery Analyst** - Performs automated discovery of Azure Integration Landing Zones and generates Integration Discovery Documents (IDD)
2. **Solution Architect** - Creates Integration Requirement Documents (IRD) based on business needs and technical requirements
3. **Implementation Agent** - Develops integration code using AZD templates and Bicep, manages GitHub issues
4. **Test Engineer** - Creates and executes tests based on requirements and implementation
5. **Documentation Specialist** - Generates comprehensive documentation for the integration solution

## Agent Prompt Files

These prompts are designed to be used sequentially, with each agent building upon the work of the previous one. The prompts are stored in the `.github/prompts/` directory and are structured to ensure a smooth workflow.

### Available Prompt Files

| File | Agent Role | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| `0-chatmodes-model-router.prompt.md` | **Model Router** | Determines the optimal AI model for each development task |

### How to Use Agent Prompts

#### Prerequisites: Model Router Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always start with the Model Router prompt before using other agents.

1. **First, run the Model Router** to determine optimal models:
   ```
   @.github/prompts/0-chatmodes-model-router.prompt.md
   ```
   
   This analyzes your tasks and assigns the most suitable AI model for each agent role based on GitHub's recommended models by task. This ensures optimal performance and accuracy for each development phase.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Configuration

The template includes a comprehensive MCP configuration (`.vscode/mcp.json`) that enables AI agents to interact with various external services and APIs. This configuration is essential for the autonomous agent workflow:

### Configured MCP Servers

- **Context7** (`https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`) - Provides access to library documentation and code examples
- **GitHub** (`https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp`) - Enables GitHub integration for issue management, PR creation, and repository operations
- **Microsoft Docs** (`https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`) - Access to official Microsoft and Azure documentation
- **Playwright** (`@playwright/mcp@latest`) - Web automation and testing capabilities
- **Azure** (`@azure/mcp@latest`) - Azure resource management and deployment operations

### Purpose in Agent Workflow

The MCP configuration enables each agent to:
- **Discovery Analyst**: Connect to Azure services to discover existing resources
- **Solution Architect**: Access documentation and best practices for requirements gathering
- **Implementation Agent**: Interact with GitHub for issue creation and project management
- **Test Engineer**: Use Playwright for end-to-end testing scenarios
- **Documentation Specialist**: Access comprehensive documentation sources

This setup ensures that AI agents have the necessary tools and context to perform their specialized tasks effectively within the Azure Integration Services development lifecycle.
