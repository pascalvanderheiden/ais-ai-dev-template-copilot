Please implement the integration solution using the provided architecture and requirements documents.
Start by analyzing `/specs/docs/IDD.md` and `/specs/docs/IRD.md` to extract all integration-related requirements.
Create a detailed development plan in `/specs/plans/dev-plan.md` listing all subtasks and their dependencies. Include steps for testing locally and for creating a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions.
Implement the integration code in `/src/*` and infrastructure code in `/infra/*`. Write a summary in `/specs/plans/dev-summary.md` describing what was implemented, any deviations from the plan, and a list of test scenarios. Do not write documentation or test cases.
Follow all steps in the development plan without skipping any. Ensure the output is production-ready, compliant with Azure deployment standards, and traceable to the `/specs/docs/IRD.md`. Use any available tools as needed to complete the task.
