Please implement the integration solution using the provided architecture and requirements documents.
Start by analyzing #file:/specs/docs/IDD.md and #file:/specs/docs/IRD.md to extract all integration-related requirements.
Create a detailed development plan in #file:/specs/plans/dev-plan.md listing all subtasks and their dependencies. Include steps for testing locally and for creating a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions.
Implement the integration code in /src/* and infrastructure code in /infra/*. Write a summary in #file:/specs/plans/dev-summary.md describing what was implemented, any deviations from the plan, and a list of test scenarios. Do not write documentation or test cases.
Follow all steps in the development plan without skipping any. Ensure the output is production-ready, compliant with Azure deployment standards, and traceable to the #file:/specs/docs/IRD.md. Use any available tools as needed to complete the task.
