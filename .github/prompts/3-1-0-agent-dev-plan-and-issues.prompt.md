Based on the specifications in `/specs/docs/IDD.md` and `/specs/docs/IRD.md`, generate a detailed development plan in `/specs/plans/dev-plan.md` that outlines all tasks required to implement the integration pattern. Include in the dev-plan local testing steps and a step for creating GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines for deploying the complete solution. Last task in the dev-plan is to write a summary in `/specs/plans/dev-summary.md` describing what was implemented, any deviations from the plan, and a list of test scenarios. After the dev-plan is complete, commit all changes in the repository to GitHub. When everything is committed to GitHub.com, create GitHub Issues for each task in the dev plan, link them to a single Epic Issue, and assign the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent to the Epic. Do not write documentation or test cases. Use any available tools as needed to complete the task.
