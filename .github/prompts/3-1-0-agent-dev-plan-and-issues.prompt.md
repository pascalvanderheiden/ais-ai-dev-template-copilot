Based on the specifications in #file:/specs/docs/IDD.md and #file:/specs/docs/IRD.md, generate a detailed development plan in #file:/specs/plans/dev-plan.md that outlines all tasks required to implement the integration pattern. Include in the dev-plan local testing steps, so successful deployment can be ensured and a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines for deploying the complete solution. Last task in the dev-plan is to write a summary in #file:/specs/plans/dev-summary.md describing what was implemented, any deviations from the plan, and a list of test scenarios. Then, create GitHub Issues for each task in the dev plan, link them to a single Epic Issue, and assign the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent to the Epic. Do not write documentation or test cases. Use any available tools as needed to complete the task.
