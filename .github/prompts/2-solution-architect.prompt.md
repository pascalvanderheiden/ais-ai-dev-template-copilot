# Autonomous Agent Flow Step

Create the IRD with the Solution Architect agent

## Solution Architect agent

Please analyze the IDD generated by the Discovery Analyst agent and create an IRD for the integration between our webshop and our Dynamics 365 backend stored in Dataverse. Our webshop can connect via APIs, and we need to be able to exchange order data, customer data and delivery status information. Orders created in the webshop must not be lost when our backend isn't up. The format used is JSON. We also need to be prepared that mappings can change over time, so generate a mapping for now, so this can be updated in the future.
