Read the [GitHub Copilot article for recommended models by task](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison#recommended-models-by-task) and assign the most suitable model for each task defined in the files under `.github/chatmodes`. Update the chat modes accordingly by only adding the model in a single line below the description and nothing more. Leave the rest of the --- in place. Use the exact naming of the model provided in the link, so GPT-4.1 and not gpt-4.1. Validate the model names for accuracy and consistency.
